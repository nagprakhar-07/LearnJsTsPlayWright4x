Rules for Keywords in JavaScript

Reserved Words: Cannot be used as variable, function, or class names. Examples: if, else, class, return, const, function.

Strict Mode Reserved Words: Words like let, static, implements are reserved in strict mode, classes, and modules (modern JS is always strict).

Future Reserved Words: enum is reserved for potential future use.

Contextual Keywords: Words like async, await, of, get, set only act as keywords in specific contexts.

Reserved Literals: true, false, null are fixed values and cannot be redefined.

Parser Behavior: Keywords are recognized during tokenization and parsing. For example, for is always treated as a loop construct, not a variable name.

👉 Example of invalid usage:

js
const for = 5; // ❌ SyntaxError
👉 Example of valid contextual usage:

js
const async = "value"; // ✅ allowed outside async function context
